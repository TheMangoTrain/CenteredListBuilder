Centered List Styler

A small app that simply takes a list of items and generates a centered-list with seperators, where no seperator exists on the start or ends of lines.

Inspiration is from musical festival posters. They traditionally have a dense band list (aka "the lineup"), where list items have seperators (like dots) and seperator never occurring on the edges of the list.

It has some useful creative applications in typography.

This app helps make a responsive HTML+CSS version of such a list.
